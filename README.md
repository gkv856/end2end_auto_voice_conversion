## This is a WIP repo, final version will be released soon

### This repo is an End-to-End pytorch implementation of 
- 'AUTOVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss' paper
- 'Generalized End-to-End Loss for Speaker Verification' (GE2E loss) paper
- **Note**: Data used here is very elementary, please prepare you own data to train the model


### Modules included in this repo
- Voice Embedding Model: model, data, training, and pre-trained model
- GE2E implementation  
- AutoVC Zero-Shot voice style transfer


### Dependencies
- Python 3
- Numpy
- PyTorch
- librosa
- tqdm
- wavenet_vocoder ```pip install wavenet_vocoder```
  for more information, please refer to [this](https://github.com/r9y9/wavenet_vocoder)



### Pre-trained models (soon to be uploaded)

| Embedding Model (GE2E) | AutoVC | WaveNet Vocoder |
